##General Guidelines

* Anyone can fork and send a Pull Request (It's the only way we support)
* Run the app locally before committing.
* Please ensure that you have synced with the upstream minimal branch. This ensures that merges go smoothly.

##Getting Started

1. Fork git repo @ https://github.com/asm-products/minimal

2. Sync to master

3. Run "npm install" to download all libs

4. Couple of ways to run the app:
    * Your local environment: "nf start --env config\.env_yourname"
    * Using Staging environment vars: "nf start --env config\.env_staging"
